# 🛡️ Network Security Challenge: Mastering Nmap, Telnet, and Hydra 🛡️

Welcome to my **Network Security Challenge** project! This challenge serves as the ultimate test of the skills and techniques I've honed in the **Network Security Module** on TryHackMe. Armed with powerful tools likee Nmap, Telnet, and Hydra, I have dived deep into the art of vulnerability scanning, remote access, and password cracking to secure and assess network environments. Join me on this journey where I break down the steps and strategies used to conquer each task, showcasing my mastery in network defense and offensive security!
